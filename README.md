## Abstract
High-intensity interval training (HIIT) is a form of interval training which generally combines short bursts of intense exercise with periods of rest or lower-intensity exercise. It is a quick and effective way to increase metabolism, improve cardiovascular endurance and build muscle which can be done anywhere without additional equipment. The purpose of this mobile application is to create a sleek, modern interval timer which is accessible on both iOS and Android. In order to do this, the application will be developed using Googleâ€™s Flutter development toolkit.

The user is able to customize the following aspects of the timer...
- Number of reps in the workout
- Time spent exercising for each rep
- Rest time between each rep
- Number of sets in the workout
- Rest time between each set
